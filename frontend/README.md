AccessiBuddy - Making Toronto accessible for everyone
🌍 Meet AccessiBuddy
An interactive map designed to make Toronto more accessible for seniors and everyone else.

Navigating a city can be tough, especially for older adults who need rest stops or accessible amenities to get around comfortably. AccessiBuddy solves this with a filterable, interactive map that pinpoints benches, public washrooms, and transit shelters across Toronto. Packed with features like location search, adjustable radius for nearby points of interest, and real-time map centering, it helps users plan routes and explore the city with ease and confidence.

🌟 Our Inspiration
Seniors often struggle to navigate urban spaces due to a lack of accessible amenities. We built AccessiBuddy to empower older adults with a simple, practical tool to find benches, washrooms, and transit shelters—boosting their mobility and independence in Toronto. Our mission? Make urban living inclusive, one map marker at a time.

💻 Behind the Scenes
AccessiBuddy is powered by a sleek, efficient tech stack:

Frontend: Next.js, JavaScript, and Leaflet for interactive mapping
Data Sources: Toronto’s open data portals for benches, washrooms, and shelters
Deployment: Vercel
💡 Challenges We Overcame
Rendering tons of map data without slowing things down was no small feat. We tackled this by using clustering and lazy loading to keep the map snappy. Plus, designing for seniors meant rethinking usability—think bigger clickable areas and clear, simple instructions. It took trial and error, but we made it work.

💼 Why We’re Proud of What We Built
We’re thrilled to have built a tool that tackles a real-world issue head-on, making Toronto more accessible for seniors. The map’s intuitive design means anyone can use it, and diving into geospatial data and mapping tech pushed our team to new heights. This is more than a project it’s a step toward inclusive cities.

⏰ What We Learned
Teamwork made the dream work. From frontend finesse to data wrangling, every member brought something unique to the table. We learned how crucial user-centered design is, especially for seniors, and got hands-on with mapping libraries and geospatial data, skills we’ll carry forward.

🚌 Where Accessibly is Headed
Toronto’s just the start. We see AccessiBuddy expanding to cities worldwide, helping seniors navigate urban jungles everywhere. Next up: adding more amenities like accessible parking or medical facilities, and maybe even syncing with transit schedules for real-time updates. The future’s wide open.
